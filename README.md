Your goal is to maximize SaaSafrasâ€™ run rate revenue 12 months from now (revenue in month 12 only, not cumulative revenue). Your responsibility is to determine where these 20 people will work for the next 12 months, and at the end of month 12 you should be generating the maximum amount of revenue in that month.
